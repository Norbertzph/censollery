# censollery
Free world, free art expression.

At first, I build a structure of the website first page of database). 
I try to create a information flow. 
There are three categories: country,issue,law,
User can find the image flow under every category,so they can go into the uncensored artworks database quickily and directly 
depends on the interests.
And I did some works on the svg, font, color, link etc. I still try my best to study how to design a diagram layout.

Secondly, I try to build a second page after the user click the image in first first page of database.
For example, when they click the CHINA image, they can get a page about all the censored artworks information in china.

Furthermore,I build a page about the upload function( the most important function in my idea).
It's rough, I still try to study how to make the visualization better, and do research on how to achieve the fuction that
website give the uncensored images back to user after uploading.

In a nutshell, it is still a immature sketch-website.

Thanks for your time
